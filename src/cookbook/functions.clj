;;; READ THIS YO
;;;  
;;; Clojure's support for higher order functions allows for you to abstract
;;; operations over collections, processes, and objects.
;;; It's one of Clojure's most powerful tools in creating lean code.
;;; It's also one of the more difficult transitions to make when learning the language.
;;;  
;;; When you're working in Clojure, it's important to learn to see data as a whole rather
;;; than as individual elements.
;;; 
;;; The process of incrementing each element in a vector of numbers by 1 like so,
;;; ```
;;; numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
;;; incremented_numbers = []
;;; for (int x in numbers) {
;;; 	x = x + 1 
;;;  	incremented_numbers.push(x)
;;; }
;;; ```
;;;  
;;; Think of it as, I want to apply a function to a collection,
;;; 
;;; ```
;;; (def numbers [1 2 3 4])
;;; (def incremented-numbers (map inc numbers))
;;; ```
;;; 
;;; The distinction might seem obvious at first.
;;; It may also seem like there isn't really a distinction to be made there.
;;; The concept will click eventually.
;;; Just always keep in mind that in Clojure, we operate on data a whole.
;; **

;; **
;;; The last detail that you need know about function calls is that Clojure evaluates all function arguments recursively before passing them to the function. 
;;; 
;;; Hereâ€™s how Clojure would evaluate a function call whose arguments are also function calls:
;;; 
;;; ```
;;; (+ (inc 199) (/ 100 (- 7 2)))
;;; (+ 200 (/ 100 (- 7 2))) ; evaluated "(inc 199)"
;;; (+ 200 (/ 100 5)) ; evaluated (- 7 2)
;;; (+ 200 20) ; evaluated (/ 100 5)
;;; 220 ; final evaluation
;;; ```
